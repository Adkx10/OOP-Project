Please download the MotorPH-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar from the release tab titled MotorPH v1.1

Then make sure to download the .csv files (except the copied csv those are for backup)

• Credentials.csv (Open this to choose what type of account to log in.)

• Employee Data.csv

• Attendance.csv

• Leave Request.csv

keep them on the same folder with the jar file for the program to run properly.

Thank you so much for Testing and your feedbacks are very much welcome!!
